        <p> Madvillain was an American hip hop duo formed in 2002, consisting of rapper MF DOOM and producer Madlib.</p>
        <p>Their only album, Madvillainy (2004), earned critical acclaim and cult popularity, widely regarded as one of the greatest rap albums of all time and a benchmark record for alternative hip hop. </p>
        <p>Their intricate rhymes and lyrics, short song structures and use of obscure, stylistically diverse samples made for a sound that was generally unfriendly to commercial radio but was lauded for its influence on underground rap.</p>
        <p>A follow-up album to Madvillainy was rumored to be in production at various times since the late 2000s,[1] but no further original material has surfaced from the duo since 2010, and MF DOOM's death in 2020 has left the future of the project uncertain.</p>
