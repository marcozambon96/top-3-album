          <p>Nights Out is the second studio album by English electronic music band Metronomy.</p><p>Released on 8 September 2008 by Because Music.
The starting point for the album was, according to lead singer Joseph Mount, "a half-arsed concept album about going out and having a crap time.</p><p>Mount wrote and recorded most of the album by himself, but instrumentalists Gabriel Stebbing and Oscar Cash "play bits on a couple of tracks on the album and it's kind of become... Metronomy used to be a him</p><p> and now it's definitely a they – which takes the heat off me a bit as well".</p><br/>

          <h2><li>808'S AND HEARTBREAK/KANYE WEST</li></h2><br/>
          <p>808s & Heartbreak is the fourth studio album by American rapper Kanye West.</p>
          <p>It was released by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 24, 2008, having been recorded earlier that year in September and October at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dominating its production, West was assisted by fellow producers No I.D., Plain Pat, Jeff Bhasker, and Mr Hudson, while also utilizing guest vocalists for some tracks, including Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, and Lil Wayne.</p>
          <p>Conceived in the wake of West's breakup with his then-fiancée Alexis Phifer and the death of his mother, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major artistic departure from his previous rap records.</p>
          <p>Instead, West performed sung vocals that were processed through an Auto-Tune processor against an electronic production and minimalist sonic palette, including prominent use of minor keys and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. West's lyrics on the album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, inspired by the distressing personal events, as well as his struggles with pop stardom.</p>
          <p>808s & Heartbreak debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling just over 450,000 copies in its first week. Despite varying responses from listeners, the album received positive reviews from most music critics, who generally commended West's experimentation, and was named one of 2008's best records in several year-end lists.</p>
          <p>Four singles were released in its promotion, including the hit singles "Love Lockdown", which became the highest Billboard Hot 100 debut of West's career, and "Heartless". Despite its positive critical reception, the album was largely overlooked as a contender for the 52nd Grammy Awards, although the single "Amazing" received a nomination in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Among West's most influential records, 808s & Heartbreak made an immediate impact on hip hop, pop, and R&B music, as a new wave of rappers, singers, and producers adopted its stylistic and thematic elements.</p>
          <p> It has been credited for pioneering the emo rap and experimental R&B subgenres in particular. Rolling Stone later included 808s & Heartbreak in its list of "The 40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time" and ranked it number 244 on its revised list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. By 2013, the album had sold 1.7 million copies in the United States, and was certified triple platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020.</p><br/><hr/>

          <h2><li>MADVILLAINY/MADVILLAIN</li></h2><br/>
     
             <p> Madvillainy is the only studio album by American hip hop duo Madvillain, consisting of British-American rapper MF Doom and American record producer Madlib. It was released on March 23, 2004, on Stones Throw Records.</p>
            <p>The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004. Madlib created most of the instrumentals during a trip to Brazil in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a Boss SP-303 sampler, a turntable, and a tape deck.</p>
            <p>Fourteen months before the album was released, an unfinished demo version was stolen and leaked onto the internet. Frustrated, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after they had released other solo projects.</p>
            <p>While Madvillainy achieved only moderate commercial success, it became one of the best-selling Stones Throw albums. It peaked at number 179 on the US Billboard 200, and attracted attention from media outlets not usually covering hip hop music, including The New Yorker. Madvillainy received widespread critical acclaim for Madlib's production and MF Doom's lyricism, and is regarded as Doom's magnum opus.</p>
            <p>It has ranked in various publications' lists of all-time greatest albums, including at 411 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,at 365 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,at 365 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,and at 18 on Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.</p>
